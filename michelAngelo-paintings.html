        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 - 18 February 1564), was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance. Born in the Republic of Florence, his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity and had a lasting influence on Western art. Michelangelo's creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas define him as an archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci. Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences, Michelangelo is one of the best-documented artists of the 16th century.

  <div class="text-center m-4 fs-5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Michelangelo achieved fame early. Two of his best-known works, the Piet√† and David, were sculpted before the age of 30. Although he did not consider himself a painter, Michelangelo created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture. At the age of 71, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. Michelangelo transformed the plan so that the Western end was finished to his design, as was the dome, with some modification, after his death.</div>

        <div style="display: inline-block;"><h4> San Spirito Crucifix 1492 </h4> Michelangelo made this nude crucifix when he was just 18 years old. It was a thank you to the Augustine monks at San Spirito who let the teen couch surf after his patron, Lorenzo de Medici, died in 1492, leaving the artist homeless. By Giorgio Vasari's account of the artist's life in his famed tome, the Lives of the Artists, it was at San Spirito that Michelangelo began to dissect dead bodies ‚Äúin order to study the details of anatomy, and began to perfect the great skill in design that he subsequently possessed.‚Äù Despite being so drawn from life (or death, as it were), the well-crafted crucifix didn't give Michelangelo's career much of a boost‚Äîin fact, most forgot that he even made it. After centuries of being assumed lost, in 1962 a media storm sprung up around it after the crucifix was rediscovered in a convent, covered over with hundreds of years of bad paint jobs. Earlier this year, it made headlines again when it was finally returned to its original home in Florence, which probably accounts for its notoriety with the public.

        <div style="display: inline-block;"><h4> Madonna of Bruges 1504 </h4>Art historian Erwin Panofsky, when writing about Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges, credited the artist with saying that a perfect sculpture is one that can be rolled downhill without suffering damage. By those standards, this sculpture would come close to perfect: The sturdy, seated composition of Mary and the Christ Child recalls the size and compact mass of the original stone block from which the figures were carved. This was the look Michelangelo was going for and, at the time, it was quite innovative. Few sculptors had attempted a project of such complexity at this scale, with the image hewn from a single slab of marble and standing at six-and-a-half feet tall.

        <div style="display: inline-block;">
          <h4>Bacchus 1497</h4> Bacchus was Michelangelo's first foray into large-scale sculpture and is one of the few works he would ever do that was not on a Christian theme. By tilting the figure ever so slightly off balance, subverting the inherent look of stability of the Classical contrapposto stance, the artist makes Bacchus‚Äîthe Roman god of wine‚Äîappear appropriately tipsy. This level of realism was unprecedented in depictions of party-loving Bacchus up until this time, revealing Michelangelo as the virtuosic perfectionist he would become known as.

        <div style="display: inline-block;">
          <h4>Dying Slave 1513-16</h4> Dying Slave was intended to accompany another work, Rebellious Slave, on either side of Moses, in Pope Julius II's tomb. In an effort to select the perfect marble for the pope's final resting place, Michelangelo went to the quarries of Carrara to hand-select the slabs of stone. When he returned, he set to work chiseling a perfect specimen of man in the languid throes of death. Then Julius changed his mind and cancelled the commission. Indeed, Dying Slave is one of six slave figures Michelangelo created over several years for the pope; Julius effectively drained the papal coffers dry in an attempt to create the perfect space for him to begin his afterlife. But the project was never fully realized, much to the artist's chagrin‚Äîespecially after having wasted nearly a year hanging around a quarry for it.

        <div style="display: inline-block;">
          <h4>Angel 1495</h4> This kneeling angel holding a candlestick, measuring just about a foot and a half in height, is one of Michelangelo's earliest works. It was created for the Arca di San Domenico in Bologna as a companion piece to the artist Niccolo dell' Arca's preexisting angel, integrated within the building's design scheme. It's historically important since it was with this work that Michelangelo started to exhibit his signature style: while dell' Arca's angel is soft and effeminate, demure in its loving embrace of its candlestick, Michelangelo's depicts a strong youth with defined musculature and eagle-like wings.

        <div style="display: inline-block;">
          <h4>Moses 1513-15</h4> Michelangelo's Moses came on the heels of his David, the public success of which had put him on Pope Julius's radar. Commissioned in 1505 by the pope for his tomb, the work represents a specific moment from the biblical tale of Moses, when he sees his people have started worshiping a pagan icon‚Äîthe Golden Calf‚Äîjust after he had trekked all the way down Mount Sinai with heavy stone slabs bearing the Ten Commandments. Needless to say, Moses was pissed, and it's precisely this anger that Michelangelo skillfully embodies in his eight-foot seated sculpture. Moses isn't just sitting down, though. His left leg and hips shift left while his muscular torso faces the right, imbuing the figure with tension and power; although he looks left, his beard whips right, indicating swift movement.

    var pietaArtDetails = `
    <img src="./Assets/images/michelangelo-paintings/Michelangelos-Pieta.jpg" style="height: 160px; display: inline-block;">
        <div style="display: inline-block;">
          <h4>Pieta 1498-99</h4> During the 15th century, the theme of Mary cradling Jesus once he was taken down from the cross‚Äîother wise known as a piet√†‚Äîwas commonly depicted in Northern European art but less so in Italy. So when a French cardinal approached 23-year-old Michelangelo to sculpt one for his funeral monument, the artist gladly accepted the challenge, knowing he could make his mark. It's the Piet√† that made people make note of Michelangelo's name‚Äîquite literally, as Vasari.

    <img src="./Assets/images/michelangelo-paintings/last-judgement.jpg" style="height: 160px; display: inline-block;">
        <div style="display: inline-block;">
          <h4>The Last Judgement 1536-41</h4> The Last Judgment, which arcs above the Sistine Chapel's altar, dramatically depicts the second coming of Christ and the final judgment of all humanity. Michelangelo squished 300 muscular figures into the sprawling scene, some representing prominent saints, others were mere mortals ascending to heaven or descending to hell. A scene of intense action, fear, awe, and copious nudity, the Last Judgment has been subject to much judgment itself, often criticized for its busyness and sometimes covered up by Papal censors.

    var creationOfAdamArtDetails = `
    <img src="./Assets/images/michelangelo-paintings/Creation_of_Adam.jpg" style="height: 160px; display: inline-block;">
        <div style="display: inline-block;">
          <h4>The Creation of Adam 1508-12</h4> Pope Julius II paused Michelangelo's long labor on the papal tomb to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The artist wasn't interested in accepting the commission‚Äîhe was a sculptor, not a painter, after all‚Äîbut he was pressured into it. So it was that Michelangelo, the supreme sculptor, created what is probably one of the most sacred images of Western art history. At the heart of the epic work is the Creation: God extends his finger toward the hand a newly minted man, Adam, about to imbue him with life (Eve watches from the crook of God's arm). Few artists had ever depicted the scene as dramatically as Michelangelo, and even in our secular age, it has made it virtually metonymic for the entire story of Genesis in contemporary culture. It is so often invoked, cited, or riffed on for its religious meaning that it may actually be possible to forget just what a terrific act of artistic theater it is.

    var davidArtDetails= `
    <img src="./Assets/images/michelangelo-paintings/michelangelo-david.jpg" style="height: 160px; display: inline-block;">
          <div style="display: inline-block;">
            <h4>David  1501-04</h4> The artist was just 26 when he sculpted David. Even at the time it brought him to the heights of artistic fame for its sheer bravura. Standing at more than 13 feet tall, the work was sculpted from a piece of marble that another artist had started carving into for another project but then abandoned because the stone was structurally compromised. This didn't deter Michelangelo, though, who knew he had the skills to make the marble work for him. The David is different than any sculpture that came before. It is drawn from the well-known Biblical story of a young boy fighting the giant Goliath. But while others chose to emphasize his smallness, Michelangelo's David is a giant himself: A muscular, confident man prepared for battle. The amazing thing, then and now, about Michelangelo's David is that the work is both literally a depiction of a larger-than-life hero, and the quintessential depiction of the plucky little guy.
